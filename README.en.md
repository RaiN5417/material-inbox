# Download Inbox

> Your Downloads folder isn't a filing cabinet.

A tiny, local-first Windows utility that asks where a download belongs while
you still remember — via a non-focus-stealing floating card, not an AI guess.

- No AI
- No cloud
- No account
- No background directory scanning (event-driven watcher only)
- Every organize is undoable; nothing is ever auto-deleted

Full product/technical spec (the source of truth for this repo):
[docs/download_inbox_product_technical_spec_v0.2.md](docs/download_inbox_product_technical_spec_v0.2.md).

## Download

Grab the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/RaiN5417/material-inbox/releases/latest) — no build tools, no manual dependencies:

- **`Download-Inbox-x64-portable.zip`** — unzip and run `download-inbox.exe` directly. No install, no admin rights.
- **`Download Inbox_x64-setup.exe`** — a normal Windows installer (Start Menu shortcut, uninstaller). Most Windows 10/11 machines already have WebView2 preinstalled; if yours doesn't, the installer downloads it during setup (visibly, with a progress window — not silently).

Windows may show a SmartScreen warning on first run (the binary isn't code-signed yet) — click "More info" → "Run anyway".

## Status

**MVP feature-complete** (milestones M0–M6 of the plan in spec section 49).
Polish pass (M7 — README, docs, benchmarks, first release) is in progress; see
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for what's still open.

## What it does

- Watches your Downloads folder (`notify`, event-driven — never polls) and
  waits for a file to actually finish downloading (size/mtime stability
  check, `.crdownload`/`.part`/`.tmp` ignored) before doing anything.
- Pops a small, non-focus-stealing **Floating Card** at the bottom-right of
  whichever monitor your mouse is on. One click files the download into a
  **Group** (a destination folder), marks it **Temporary** (auto-expires
  into a cleanup queue, never auto-deleted), or **Later** (handle it from
  the main window instead).
- Several files landing close together collapse into one **batch card**
  instead of popping once per file.
- Every move is **logged and undoable** — same-name collisions never
  overwrite, they get `(1)`, `(2)`, ... suffixes.
- **Temporary** files that expire land in a cleanup queue where you can keep
  them longer, file them into a group, or send them to the Recycle Bin
  (never a permanent delete from inside the app).
- Lives in the system tray; closing the main window just hides it.

## Why?

Files land with no record of why you downloaded them. A few days later the
context is gone, and folder-by-extension auto-sorting just moves the mess
somewhere else. This project moves the organizing moment earlier: ask once,
right when you still remember, instead of sorting later when you don't.

## Architecture

```text
React UI (apps/desktop/src)
        │  Tauri IPC + events
        ▼
Tauri / Rust core (apps/desktop/src-tauri)
        ├── file-watcher      — OS file events, event-driven only
        ├── download-detector — is this path a finished, operable file yet?
        ├── event-engine      — batches ready files so 20 downloads ≠ 20 cards
        ├── file-operations   — the only crate allowed to move/rename/trash files
        ├── storage           — SQLite pool + migrations + repositories
        └── domain            — pure model, no Tauri/SQLite/Windows deps
```

## Building from source

Prerequisites (none of this is bundled — install once):

1. [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable; `rustfmt` + `clippy` components)
2. [Node.js 22.13+](https://nodejs.org/) (pnpm 11 requires it)
3. `corepack enable` (ships pnpm with Node) or `npm i -g pnpm`
4. [Tauri's Windows prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) —
   WebView2 (preinstalled on most Windows 10/11) and the MSVC C++ build tools

Then:

```bash
pnpm install --dir apps/desktop
pnpm --dir apps/desktop tauri dev
```

`cargo build` / `cargo test` work from the repo root against the workspace
without touching the frontend. The app icon in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/icons/`
is a placeholder — see the README there before a real release.
